## Introduction to Data Products

Monte Carlo provides Data Products functionality that enables organizations to build and manage data products effectively. Data Products serve as a way to organize, tag, and monitor data assets within the Monte Carlo platform.

## Key Components

### Building Data Products
- Process for creating and structuring data products within Monte Carlo
- Framework for organizing related data assets under a unified product structure
- Integration with Monte Carlo's data observability capabilities

### Asset Tagging
- Comprehensive tagging system for all data assets
- Ability to categorize and organize assets within data products
- Tagging enables better discoverability and management of data resources

### Data Product Dashboards
- Dedicated dashboard functionality for data products
- Visual interface for monitoring and managing data product health
- Integration with Monte Carlo's observability metrics and alerts

## Available Resources

### Documentation
- Detailed guide on using Data Product Dashboards available in Monte Carlo documentation
- Step-by-step instructions for implementation and management

### Training Materials
- Video tutorial (Vimeo ID: 1037891241) covering:
  - Introduction to Data Products concepts
  - How to build a Data Product
  - Asset tagging procedures
  - Dashboard creation and management

## Implementation Areas

### Data Asset Organization
- Framework for structuring data assets within products
- Tagging methodology for comprehensive asset management
- Integration with existing data infrastructure

### Monitoring and Observability
- Dashboard-based monitoring of data product health
- Integration with Monte Carlo's data quality and reliability features
- Visual representation of data product status and metrics
